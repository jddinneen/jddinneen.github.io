<h1 id="bwp3-information-and-society">BWP3 Information and Society</h1>
<p><strong>Prof. Dinneen</strong> • <strong>Wintersemester 2020-2021</strong></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>This course enables students to reflect on the role of technology in shaping today’s <em>information society</em> from various social, societal, and ethical perspectives, and to consider what information professionals and scholars can therefore do to affect, and hopefully improve, society.</p>
<h2 id="delivery-modes-and-languages">Delivery Modes and Languages</h2>
<p>BWP3 consists of seminars (HS) on Tuesday afternoons and lectures (VL) on Wednesday afternoons, each starting at 12:15 and ending by 13:45. The course will be conducted via synchronous online delivery, but includes flexibility for asynchronous study as needed. One link to the Zoom session for all VL &amp; HS is available on the course <a href="https://moodle.hu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=97753">Moodle page</a>.</p>
<p>The VL consist primarily of content delivered by the professor or guest lecturers and integrated class discussion via voice, video, and/or textual chat messages (as the student prefers). Recordings of the lectures will be provided, but students are encouraged to attend whenever possible.</p>
<p>The HS consist of various tutorials and activities, outlined below, including student presentations, written assignments, and discussion. The HS-before-VL schedule maximises the time students have to consider lecture content before the next seminar.</p>
<h4 id="language-requirements">Language requirements</h4>
<p><em>The course will be conducted primarily in English, but with flexibility to accommodate students’ varied linguistic backgrounds and skills/challenges, which are also considered in the design and delivery of course materials and in the review of assessments.</em> All assignments may be submitted in English or German. In general, linguistic performance will not be assessed, and students are therefore encouraged to participate in English as much as possible.</p>

<h4 id="vl-participation">VL Participation</h4>
<p>Students should attend lectures and participate in discussions whenever possible via voice or text chat (English/German). If necessary, students may instead watch the lecture recordings and post text comments (English/German) on the lecture recordings to extend the class discussion. Such comments must be like those in the live meetings – on topic, respectful, coherent – and no more than 150 words in length, and posted before the next VL. VL participation is <em>pass/fail</em>, i.e. discussing in the VL meeting, or posting according to the requirements for all module weeks, will earn the Leistungspunkte (LP).</p>
<h4 id="hs-participation">HS Participation</h4>
<p>HS participation is comprised of discussion, tutorials, student presentations, and written assignments. Students should attend and participate in seminars synchronously (i.e. <em>live</em>) whenever possible. If necessary, students may discuss/present asynchronously (e.g., posting on Moodle and uploading recorded presentation videos before the HS meeting begins). All HS participation is <em>pass/fail</em>, i.e. presenting, participating, and submitting assignments according to the basic requirements will earn the LP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion in the HS meetings serves to introduce new course themes or review the results of written assignments. Students should attend and participate.</li>
<li>Tutorials serve to prepare students for researching and writing about course topics and big questions in LIS. Students should attend and participate.</li>
<li>Presentations should briefly synthesise one narrow topic from the VL of the week prior, and then explain and justify a position / opinion with regards to that topic and with reference to relevant scholarly literature and/or reputable press. Presentations should last 10 minutes (a script may be used), end with a clear takeaway, and then pose 3-5 questions for class discussion, which the presenter will lead/moderate (or respond to comments if posting a video). Students are therefore expected to attend others’ presentations and participate in the discussions. The presentation schedule will be decided at the start of the course according to enrolment, but 1 presentation per student is likely.</li>
<li>Written assignments consist of three short responses, one short essay outline, one short essay draft, and one short feedback on 1-2 students’ drafts, all of which will be reviewed in the discussion activities. The short responses provide reflection on and practice writing about the course topics, as well as useful feedback to other students; further details will be provided in the course. The essay outline and draft in particular are designed to synthesise student’s thoughts, demonstrate learning, and prepare students to write the MAP. Details of both the outline and essay draft will be provided in the course. The format and length of the essay draft follows that of the MAP Fachartikel (below), but note however, the HS essay draft is <em>not</em> an exam: it must be submitted to receive credit but is otherwise not marked, and requires considerably less preparation than a MAP. Therefore, students may use a revised version of their essay draft as the basis for their MAP submission, or they may write on entirely separate topics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="map-fachartikel">MAP Fachartikel</h4>
<p>The Fachartikel (English/German) is an essay with original synthesis and argumentation using suitable evidence and reasoning to support a coherent, and ideally but not necessarily novel, point / opinion about a topic covered in the VL or HS. After a brief introduction the author should deeply analyse the chosen topic and give support for their thesis, and then end by discussing what, if anything, the LIS field can do to have an impact on the topic or on the public perception of / participation in it, etc. The article should be ca. 6.000 to 10.000 characters (excluding spaces) and therefore ca. 3 to 5 pages, in <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa6_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html">APA6</a> style, in English or German.</p>
<h2 id="readings-and-resources">Readings and Resources</h2>
<p>Preparation for the course requires reading before the lectures and preparing for presentations and participation in the seminars. Readings and resources will be provided on Moodle, and may vary from news reports to scholarly essays. In addition to the required readings, students are expected to read from 2-3 supplementary readings, chosen according to their personal and professional interests. Students are encouraged to read and consider the content deeply and patiently, but especially challenging readings will be clarified in lectures.</p>
