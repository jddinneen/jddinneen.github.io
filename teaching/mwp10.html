<p><strong>Prof. Dinneen</strong> • <strong>Summer Semester 2022</strong></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>In this course students learn about the background and current landscape of information governance and information ethics. In doing so we will examine the role of information and technology in shaping today's society from various social, societal, and ethical perspectives, and will analyse relevant factors in technology, politics, and policy. Upon completion of the course, students will have both a broad and deep understanding of the need for and development of information governance and information ethics and will be able to discuss how these requirements are met by information institutions and research.</p>
<h2 id="delivery-modes-and-languages">Delivery Modes and Languages</h2>
<p>MWP10 consists of in-person seminars (HS) on Tuesday afternoons and in-person lectures (VL) on Wednesday afternoons, each starting at 12:15 and ending by 13:45. Please find the room location and further details on the course Moodle page. The VL consist primarily of lectures with some integrated class discussion, whereas the HS consist of student presentations and various discussion activities, some of which require students to prepare in advance. Students are expected to attend both VL &amp; HS.</p>
<h4 id="language-requirements">Language requirements</h4>
<p>The course will be conducted primarily in English. <em>Please note that students' varied linguistic backgrounds, skills, and challenges have been considered in the design and delivery of course materials and in the review of assessments; generally, linguistic performance will not be assessed!</em> Written assignments (e.g. the <em>'MAP'</em>) may be submitted in English or German.</p>

<h4 id="hs-participation">HS Participation</h4>
<p><strong>Presenting</strong> &amp; <strong>actively discussing</strong> according to the following requirements will earn the 4 <em>Leistungspunkte</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentations should briefly introduce one narrow topic relevant to the VL <em>from the week prior</em> (e.g. a presentation about VL5 happens in HS6) and then provide deeper relevant details according to the student's interests (e.g. professional, scholarly, personal interests) and with reference to scholarly literature and reputable press. Presentations should last 20-25 minutes (a script may be used) and end with (a) a clear conclusion and (b) 3 open-ended questions to stimulate class discussion. <em>The presentation schedule will be decided at the start of the semester. Note: it is permissible -- and efficient -- to write the MAP essay on the same topic as your presentation!</em></li>
<li>Discussions in the HS meetings serve to introduce new course themes or present the results of short assignments. Students are expected to attend and actively participate in the majority of discussions, as well as participate in the discussion at the end of other students' presentations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="vl-participation">VL Participation</h4>
<p><em>Actively</em> and respectfully participating in the <em>majority</em> of class discussions will earn the 2 <em>Leistungspunkte</em>.</p>
<h4 id="map-essay">MAP Essay</h4>
<p>The MAP Hausarbeit is an essay with original synthesis and argumentation using suitable evidence and reasoning to support a coherent and novel thesis about a topic covered in the module. After a brief introduction the author should deeply analyse the chosen topic, give support for their thesis, and then – importantly – end by discussing what, if anything, the LIS field can do to have an impact on the topic (broadly construed). The essay should be ca. 40.000 characters (excluding spaces) and therefore ca. 20 pages, in <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html">APA7</a> style, in English or German.</p>
<h2 id="readings-and-resources">Readings and Resources</h2>
<p>Readings and resources will be provided on Moodle prior to each week. In addition to assigned readings, students are expected to select (according to their interests) and read 2-3 supplementary readings each week from the course bibliography.</p>
